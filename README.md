# LeetCodeMaxPointsOnALine
Submission for max points on a line HARD problem

Idea for using slopes inspired from problem discussion - but I didn't copy any code from there. You can see in my commit history how this evolved.

After spending a couple of hours writing this solution I find that the test cases are using slopes with precision greater than double or Decimal datatype.

Methinks the test setter wanted to show their superior math prowess, rather than set the developer a reasonable problem to generate the algorithm (which is really the point)

I wasn't going to spend hours refactoring to use GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) just to pass an online test so left it there...
