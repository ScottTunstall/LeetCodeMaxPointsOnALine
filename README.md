# LeetCodeMaxPointsOnALine
Submission for max points on a line

This works to pass the demo test cases but then I find it needs to be refactored to work with slopes.

Why didn't the Leetcode example just SAY this instead of giving misleading examples? I didn't want to click the "Solution" tab and cheat.

I'm actually close to cracking the solution, just don't know if I can be bothered. 

I'll leave this here so you can see my thinking.
